### Description:

This project focused on developing my skills on JavaScript. The design of the project was focused ona single page, which was the play button. I created a football quiz app that allowed the user to click on questions. The main focus on the application was allowing the quiz to update the questions without having a different page for each page for the question.

The user can interact with the home page and then from there they can click on the buttons which display an animation that last for a few milliseconds. Once the user clicks on the play button this will take them to the quiz where it will ask them 20 questions based on football. The buttons have animation and although the quiz isn't actually completed, I decided that I would instead focus on a project that would be utilising JavaScript opposed to having a focus on HTML and CSS.

In the quiz the user has 20 questions in which they can answer. They are not in a set order but rather they are designed so that if the user refreshes the page then the questions would be in a different order.

### Prerequisites:
- Any Modern Browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox)

### Description:

This project focused on developing my skills on JavaScript. The design of the project was focused ona single page, which was the play button. I created a football quiz app that allowed the user to click on questions. The main focus on the application was allowing the quiz to update the questions without having a different page for each page for the question.

The user can interact with the home page and then from there they can click on the buttons which display an animation that last for a few milliseconds. Once the user clicks on the play button this will take them to the quiz where it will ask them 20 questions based on football. The buttons have animation and although the quiz isn't actually completed, I decided that I would instead focus on a project that would be utilising JavaScript opposed to having a focus on HTML and CSS.

In the quiz the user has 20 questions in which they can answer. They are not in a set order but rather they are designed so that if the user refreshes the page then the questions would be in a different order.

### Prerequisites:
- Any Modern Browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox)
- Any IDE to view code (Preferably Atom or Brackets)
- Access to developer tools on web browser

### What I Learnt:
- Arrays in JavaScript
- Using JavaScript to find elements in HTML

### Constraints
I had an idea that when the user was on the quiz and they accidently refreshed the page, it would give them a confirmation box that would ask them if they wanted to leave the page or not. I did get it working but when the user started the quiz it would give them the dialog box and keep on asking them. I did find different ways to reduce the problem into a less of a problem but I decided in the end that I would leave this out.

### Improvements:
- Improvement ID: Footer
- Description: 

I think the first thing I should do is re-add the footer back. I did have a problem with this because it wasn't working as intended. I know the fix, but I decided I would save this for another time. But I was thinking of maybe adding in some social media buttons that would help me style it or use some text and apply animation over it.

- Improvement ID: Video Overlap
- Description: 

The video works fine in mobile mode however, if you resize the webpage to a certain size it will cause the user to scroll to the side showing an empty space that is not used. I have a few ideas on how I could approach this but for now I will leave this for another time and fix it later. I would rather go through my solutions first and find the best way before attempting to fix the problem.

- Improvement ID: New Logo
- Description:

I did use a logo off the internet, which was non-copyright. This logo did have a white background which made the columns break, however I can just find a new image with the same height and diameter to solve this problem.

- Improvement ID: Textbox and Image
- Description:

This problem isn't big but I could change the font size and add an animation to it and I could also work on changing the image for it because it doesn't fit and it has an odd shadow box that just doesn't fit with the image.

- Improvement ID: Navbar Background Color
- Description: 

I don't like the navbar background so I am going to change it to something else and maybe I might add in an animation so that it changes to another colour when hovered over.
